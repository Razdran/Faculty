The assessment procedure implies:
D – midterm project (week #9): Web application's requirements, UI design & general (service-oriented, serverless,...) software architecture.
P – final project (week #16 – during finals session): from conceptual modeling to full implementation (solution + demo).
test samples
Ti, i ? [1, 4] – a number of 4 open book written tests – at the end of several lectures, without prior notification; duration: 10 minutes.
Ei, i ? [1, 4] – a number of 4 practical exercises – during lab classes, without prior notification; maximum duration: 15 minutes.

The assessment of each D and P components will provide 0—10 points – consult the list of requirements & deliverables. Each Ti and Ei, with i ? [1, 4], will be evaluated with maximum 2.5 points.
Grading formula is D * 0.3 + P * 0.5 + T * 0.1 + E * 0.1,
where T = sum(Ti : i ? [1, 4]) and E = sum(Ei : i ? [1, 4]).

In order to pass, an enrolled student must obtain minimum 5 points for all – D, P, T, and E – components.
Other aspects of interest

Significant contributions – including the involvement in open source/data-related scientific research and/or technical (inter)national projects, competitions, events, etc. – might bring maximum 2 points to the final mark.
Failed D and/or P components could be reevaluated with a 2 point penalty.

Nota bene : no re-assessments for Ti tests and Ei exercises.
The partial grades of failed students from previous years are not taken into consideration.

 14 weeks (full activity) + 2 weeks for evaluation?
Final grade = round(40% * Exam + 60% * Lab)?
Exam: max 40 points, midterm exam?
Lab: max 60 points = 20 lab activity + 40 semester project?
* bonus points!?
Criteria: min 50 (Exam + Lab)?
